The main goal of this proyect was to aply in a simple way the structure of the following page: `https://www.fcbarcelona.es/es/futbol/primer-equipo/jugadores`

    In my case, I designed a simple home-page trying to emulate the structure of the cards that contained all the players and their effects.
